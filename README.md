## **Description**
ChoiceTheorem's overhauled village is a structure datapack package as a mod for forge and fabric that enhances and creates new villages and pillager outpost variants. This pack adds 20 village variants and pillager outpost variants that perfectly fit into your Minecraft worlds. The existing villages are rebuilt from the ground up and each biome type can generate two types of structures. In total, there are 23 village variants and 14 pillager outpost variants tailored to suit the terrain, theme and biomes.

There will be no backporting beyond 1.18.2 for the mod version and 1.17 for the datapack version. 

<details><summary>FAQs</summary>
These are just some of the most asked questions I've had from people, but if you have any more, please leave a comment down below and I'll try to help you as best we can.

**1. Is it safe to update CTOV to a newer version?**<br/>
Yes. If any serious problems arise because of that, let me know.

**2. Is it safe to add CTOV to an already existing world?**<br/>
Yep. Just note that the new structures will only spawn in newly generated chunks.

**3. Is this mod for Forge or Fabric/Quilt?**<br/>
All of them. I have a universal version for three mod loaders.

**4. How can I locate the new structures?**<br/>
For 1.18.2: /locate ctov:[structure_from_list]
For 1.19+: /locate structure ctov:[structure_from_list]

**5. Does CTOV existing vanilla structures?**</br>
The only structures modified by CTOV are **vanilla villages** in older versions.

**6. What about the loot of these structures?**<br />
The vast majority of structures use vanilla loot tables for better mod compatibility (see the Compatibility section below for more info), but they also use some custom loot tables to better integrate said structures into the world. You will still find pillager outpost loot in pillager outposts, profession chests in villages, as well as bells, workstations, etc., but also new stuff like food, armour, and other goodies. and you can swap the config folder to adjust to the original OP chest loot.

**7. How can I report bugs/issues/suggestions?**<br/>
Please go to my GitHub repo and make an issue there. A discord message will do.

**8. Can I include CTOV in my modpack?**<br/>
Sure, but make sure to give credit and a link to our page.

**9. Can I have CTOV for 1.x.x, please?**<br/>
If it's lower than 1.18.2, no. Just don't ask this question. The technical limit is too high here.

**10. Can I give Choicetheorem any commission or support?**<br/>
I can't take any commissions or monetary support due to a lack of time and mean to receive payments.
